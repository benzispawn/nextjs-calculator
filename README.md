# Next.js Calculator App

## Overview
This project is a simple calculator built with **Next.js** as part of a test to compare the main differences between Next.js, Angular, and React frameworks. The goal is to observe how each framework handles basic UI rendering, state management, and user interaction.

## Features
- Basic calculator functionality (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Uses React's `useState` hook within Next.js for state management.
- Modern minimalist design using simple CSS.
- Built-in support for server-side rendering (SSR), although SSR is not used in this particular app.

## Setup
1. Clone the project.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
